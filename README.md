# who-ears-social-listening

## Purpose of this project

Oftentimes the most innovative ideas are born out of the intersection of multiple disciplines in both technology and public health. In this session we will discuss what this looks like in practice by leveraging an actual use case, â€œExploring Social Media indicators to Predict COVID-19 Trends, by beginning with initial experimentation and ending with production and publication of the outcomes of the research.
