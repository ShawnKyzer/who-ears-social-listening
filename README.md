# who-ears-social-listening

### IMPORTANT: This repository is currently a work in progress and should be considered as such. In the coming months we will continue to finalize the codebase, outcomes and update references. It is also important to note that this repository is for research purposes. 

## Purpose of this project

Oftentimes the most innovative ideas are born out of the intersection of multiple disciplines in both technology and public health. In this session we will discuss what this looks like in practice by leveraging an actual use case, â€œExploring Social Media indicators to Predict COVID-19 Trends", by beginning with initial experimentation and ending with production and publication of the outcomes of the research.

We would like to democratize our research and data to share with the larger community. In this repository you will find our ingestion pipelines, notebook experiments and with time our machine learning pipelines and deployment to production. We hope this will serve as a guide for anyone who wants to test out a hypothesis and make available these findings to the world using best practices in research, data engineering and machine learning.
